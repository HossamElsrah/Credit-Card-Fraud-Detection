# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. The goal is to identify patterns and predict whether a transaction is fraudulent using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to the transaction, and the target variable indicates whether the transaction was fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Project Overview

Fraud detection in credit card transactions is critical for preventing financial losses and ensuring the security of transactions. In this project, we used several machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions. Key steps in this project include:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Loading and cleaning the dataset, checking for missing values and duplicates, and handling outliers to improve the quality of the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data distribution, visualizing the features, and checking correlations with the target variable to understand the data better.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Scaling and normalizing numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale and making them suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Building**: Using classification models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict fraud. Each model is evaluated using recall as the primary metric to ensure high detection of fraud.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using precision, recall, F1 score, and the ROC curve to assess performance. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to improve model accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of features and understanding their correlation with the target variable (fraud).
- **Scaling & Normalization**: Applying standard scaling to numerical features to ensure fair comparison across models.
- **Model Selection**: Testing multiple models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to determine the best classifier for fraud detection.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV to fine-tune the models for optimal performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluating the models based on recall, precision, F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**, which contains transaction data with features like the amount of transaction, time of transaction, and anonymized features representing transaction attributes.

- **Target Variable**: `fraud` (binary classification: 1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud)
- **Feature Variables**: Various anonymized features representing different characteristics of the transaction.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, you will need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, you can run the Jupyter notebook to start analyzing the dataset. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize key relationships in the data.
3. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, scaling features).
4. Train and evaluate various machine learning models.
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
6. Evaluate the final models using various metrics (recall, precision, F1 score, ROC curve).

Run the following code to start training the models:

```python
# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('credit_card_fraud.csv')

# Preprocess the data (handle missing values, scale features)
# Train the models
# Evaluate models (print recall, precision, F1 score, etc.)
```

## Results

The model evaluation will give you an insight into the performance of different models based on recall, precision, and F1 score. The model with the highest recall should be chosen to maximize fraud detection while keeping false positives to a minimum.
